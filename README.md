# LRG-Fundamentals
Official LRG Fundamentals Arma 3 Mod.


This is the Arma 3 mission-making framework created by Last Resort Gaming. LRG Fundamentals allows the easy creation of modded missions
for Arma 3.

## Setting up and Building

Create a directory called `z` on the P: drive. Clone the repository into the subdirectory `LRG Fundamentals` such that the folder `addons` is located in the following path:

```P:\z\LRG Fundamentals\addons```

Using [pboProject][pboproj] by Mikero, set the source directory to the `addons` directory, and the destination to e.g. `P:\@LRG Fundamentals`. The private key is required to build properly signed pbos for distribution, this key is only available to members of the LRG Development Team.

If you have questions about the build process or encounter issues, please let us know via a message on [Discord][discord] or by submitting an issue ticket here.
