# Documentation Generation

LRG Fundamentals uses [Natural Docs](https://www.naturaldocs.org/) to generate
the project documentation.

You need to download the compiled program in zip-archive format from the main
website and extract the contained `Natural Docs` folder **in its entirety** to the `tools` directory.

The zip can be obtained [here](https://www.naturaldocs.org/download/natural_docs/2.0.2/Natural_Docs_2.0.2.zip).

The file `NaturalDocs.exe` should be in the following place (going from the project root) after extracting:

**`tool\Natural Docs\NaturalDocs.exe`**
